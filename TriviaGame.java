Description: The questions that are to be asked in the trivia game are stored in an array of TriviaQuestion objects. This, in
additional to the score and questionNum are fields in the class. The questionNum field is used to store the last
question that was asked (initially set to 0). The constructor needs an array of questions. Make sure to use the
Arrays.copyOf() method here to copy the questions into the game and not link (copy by reference) to the
questions in the driver class. This is an important habit to get into.
The askNextQuestion() method should return true if there are more questions and false otherwise. In this
method you are to prompt the user to answer the question, use a Scanner object to read in the response and if
it matches the answer (ignore case) then add the value of the question into their score. You also need a method
showScore() to print out the userâ€™s current score, a method restart() to reset the score and the questionNum
fields. Finally, you need an accessor method for the score field.
